# Go + HTMX Starter 

I didn't like any of the current GO/HTMX starter out there, so I decided to build my own.
I hadn't found any templates out there that had proper hot reloading, which IMO is very important for UI work.
So, my goal was to create the simplest base I could start working with. The HR definitively jank, but it works most of the time.

## Development

Use the following command to start your web page at http://localhost:3000
```sh
./watch-dev.sh # to start developing with hot reload
```

Right now it has no build step, but I'll update this eventually when I need to deploy the project this is based off.
